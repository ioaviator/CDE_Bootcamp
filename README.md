### Shell Scripting with Bash

### Project Description:
The aim of this project is to demostrate the use of shell scripting in developing and automating data engineering tasks

### Requirements
Understanding of shell scripting (Bash)
Understanding of SQL Queries

### Project Components:
Data Acquisition: Connecting to online data source using bash scripts 

Data Transformation: Utilizing bash scripts to extract specific columns

Data Intergration: Loading data into PostgreSQL database for structured querying and analysis. 
Moving data from one directory to another

### Usage
- Fork the repository
- Clone the repository to your local environment.  `git clone https://repo-url`
- Open the cloned folder with your terminal
- Checkout to the linux branch `git checkout linux`
- Navigate into the Scripts/bash directory `cd Scripts/bash`
- Create a config.env and error.log file
- Inside config.env, create these .env variables

```
# example config variables

OUTPUT_FILE=annual-enterprise-survey-2023-fin-yr-provisional.csv

FILE_URL=URL_OF_DATA_TO_EXTRACT

RAW_DIR_PATH=raw

TRANSFORM_DIR=Transformed

GOLD_DIR=Gold

# Define the source and destination directories
source_dir=json_csv_raw
destination_dir=json_and_csv

# Define the log file for error messages
ERROR_LOG=error.log

# Database credentials
DB_NAME=posey
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres_password
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
```
- Grant permission to the scripts 

```
chmod +x ETL/*
chmod +x main.sh
```
### Schedule Cron Job
  From terminal, type 
  
  ```
  $(pwd)
  ```
  This will geenrate the path to the current working directory

- Open the cron scheduler in the terminal `crontab -e`
- Add the following line to schedule the main.sh script to run every day at 12:00 AM

```
0 0 * * * /path/to/your/main.sh
```
- Save and exit the cron editor
- Run the script `bash main.sh`

## CAVEATS
Because of the differences in environment between windows and linux, you might encounter some errors when executing this program in a linux based environment. 
The reason is because of the LF (Line Feed) and CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) differences between Linux and Windows

```
./config.env: line 2: $'\r': command not found
./config.env: line 4: $'\r': command not found
```
To fix this, simply convert the scripts to LF when running the scripts in linux environment

```
dos2unix ./config.env
dos2unix etl/*
dos2unix main.sh
dos2unix move_files.sh
dos2unix csv_to_database.sh
```

### Executing move_files.sh and csv_to_database.sh scripts

`move_files.sh`: moves csv and json files from json_csv_raw directory to  json_and_csv directory

`csv_to_database.sh`: move csv files from parch_posey directory to postgreSQL database

Make sure the environment variables are all set up. 
You can modify the variable values to suit your needs
```
# Define the source and destination directories
source_dir=json_csv_raw
destination_dir=json_and_csv

# Define the log file for error messages
ERROR_LOG=error.log

# Database credentials
DB_NAME=posey
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres_password
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
```
Grant permission to script
```
chmod +x move_files.sh
chmod +x csv_to_database.sh
```
Run the script
```
bash move_files.sh
bash csv_to_database.sh
```

### Running SQL Scripts
- Navigate to sql directory
- The directory contains a .sql file which contains SQL queries
- Manually import the .sql file into your postgreSQL software

### Analytical Queries

- Find a list of order IDs where either gloss_qty or poster_qty is greater than 4000. Only include the id field in the resulting table.
```
SELECT id FROM orders 
WHERE gloss_qty > 4000 OR poster_qty > 4000
```
<br >

- Write a query that returns a list of orders where the standard_qty is zero and either the gloss_qty or poster_qty is over 1000

```
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE standard_qty = 0 AND (gloss_qty > 100 OR poster_qty > 100)
```
<br>

- Find all the company names that start with a 'C' or 'W', and where the primary contact contains 'ana' or 'Ana', but does not contain 'eana'
```
SELECT name
FROM accounts
WHERE (name LIKE 'C%' OR name LIKE 'W%')
  AND (primary_poc LIKE '%ana%' OR primary_poc LIKE '%Ana%')
  AND primary_poc NOT LIKE '%eana%'
```

- Provide a table that shows the region for each sales rep along with their associated accounts.  Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. 
Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) by account name
 
```
SELECT s_rep.name AS sales_rep, rgn.name AS region, acct.name AS account_name 
FROM sales_reps AS s_rep
LEFT JOIN region AS rgn 
	ON s_rep.region_id = rgn.id
RIGHT JOIN accounts AS acct 
	ON acct.sales_rep_id = s_rep.id
ORDER BY account_name
```
